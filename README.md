## Information
This is where we will provide updates, documentation and possibly alternatives, to the stock firmware for the DC540 Tarot Badge,
released at DEFCON 30 in Las Vegas.

Raw code?  Not at this time.

Gerbers?  Not on your life.  Not so much about being protective of the design; there's nothing secretive or trademarkable here.  I just don't want y'all to see how horrible my routing is. :)
